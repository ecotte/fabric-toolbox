# ‚ö° SparkMonitoring RTI Accelerator

A project designed to accelerate the deployment and experience of the Spark Monitoring solution in Microsoft Fabric. It provides a visual overview of cluster health, resource constraints, and enables comparison between two Spark applications.

## üìã Description

This accelerator provisions a workspace pre-configured with all necessary resources and settings to monitor Spark workloads in Fabric. It helps users:

- View cluster health and performance metrics
- Identify resource bottlenecks
- Compare two Spark applications side-by-side

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Sync the `Config` folder** via Git repo using the **Microsoft Fabric UI**. (or alternatively just download the .ipynb file)
2. Open the notebook and **update the settings at the top**.
3. Run the notebook Platform_Monitoring_Setup.Notebook

Once executed, this will:

- Create a workspace with the required resources
- Attach the necessary properties to the environments that you choose.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Steps

After running the notebook, complete the following **manual configuration steps**:

1. Update the **connection config** in the **Semantic Model** to point to your Eventhouse.
2. Publish the **Environments** settings to ensure configuration values are applied correctly.
